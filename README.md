<h1>HTML and CSS Task</h1>
</div>


>## Brief

    
<br>
Instructions: Using REPLIT, build a simple HTML & CSS-driven website made up of linked pages and styled content. Using HTML semantics, you should have a header, main, and footer tag in each page.  


<br>

>## Instructions

Each page should have links leading to the other pages in a navigation bar at the header. For example, on the About page (home page) there should be a navigation bar containing links to the contact page, registration page and login page :

<br>

>### About Me (this should be your home page)
The following should be included in your About Me page (creatively use ordered and unordered lists here):
- Your name
- A paragraph about yourself.
- Hobbies, priorities, and other skills
- Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, add a photo of yourself.

<br>

>### Contact page
Create a big, fancy Contact Me button at the bottom of the home page that will load the contact page when clicked on. 
<br>

The contact me page should have a form with the below fields. The form should have a submit button and basic HTML validation.
- Name
- Email
- Message

<br>

>### Registration page
It should have the below fields with HTML validation as well.
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone
- Gender (dropdown)
- Country
- State/province
- Email
- password
- Confirm password

<br>

>### Login page.

- Add a login page with an Email field and a password field. 
- Add basic HTML validation to the login form. 
- It should have a submit button with the label "Sign In."
